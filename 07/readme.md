No luck to solve part1. Firstly it stuck on parsing user input `$ cmd args`.
When I fixed that, it throws error on accessing `.values()` on undefined on line 30.
This looks like unsolvable because chatbot didn't return full response on any output and had a lot of timeouts and too much requests errors.
