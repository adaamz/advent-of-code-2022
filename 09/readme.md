Part 1 was almost done 4 times! But chatbot always crashed or freezed, so no way to finish it.
I lost whole day without any achievement (not at least example!), so very sad at the end.
Firstly AI didn't understand wat is the question (what should it find to compute).
Then it struggle with head!=tail, it was still moving tail onto head.
Then it was doing immediate moves, it just missed whole traveled path but it was rather teleporting 
tail one step behind head.
The last problem that remains is when head and tail are diagonally and head is moved 1 step, it 
results to again teleporting tail onto head while i suppose it should remain where it is.
